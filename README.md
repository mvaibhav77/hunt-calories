# hunt-calories
A Simple pure JavaScript project to track your calories made using ES6 modules.

Just add the name of the foot item & its calories and it will be added to a list of foot items. The total calories of the foodlist will be shown at the front. You can also edit and delete previosly added food items.
If you accidentally refresh the page or you want to review your foodlist later, I also integrated the food item list to the localstorage.

I made this project with the help of Modern JavaScript Course by Brad Traversy on Udemy. 

I used the following tools to make it:
1. Materialize CSS for styling.
2. JavaScript - ES6 Module Pattern
3. LocalStorage for storing data
4. Node.js (Express) for deployment on Heroku
